The Catalina Kayak Adventure

This is my final project submission for Python 4970.

It is a simple "platformer" style game where the player "the kayak" is trying to make it from one island to the next.

On the way to the next island, there are rocks and 3 different sea creatures that must be avoided.

Running into either of them will restart the player's level and put them back on the island.

The enemies have different movement speeds, and different movement rotations. (i.e the whales move slower and in circles)

Once the kayak has made it to the other island, they can continue on to the next level, the level counter in the top left will keep track of the level the player is on.
